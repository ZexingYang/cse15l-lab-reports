# CSE15L_Week1_lab_Zexing_Yang

I have already downloaded visual studio before.










Me logging into remote computer with my username. I tried some commands like pwd: print working directory and ls: list files and directories









Ls -lat: list directories with three options: l :showing file information    a: all   t: sort by time
Mkdir : make a directory called foo
Then I use touch foo.txt to create a new text file under foo directory and use vim to open and edit foo.txt
