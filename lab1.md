I have already downloaded visual studio before.

I was using my username to access a distant computer. The first few lines show the results of my local computer search. I then used SSH (Secure Shell) to log into cse15l account and tried some commands like pwd:print working directory and ls: file and directory listing

Ls -lat: list directories with three options: l :showing file information    a: all   t: sort by time
Mkdir : make a directory called foo

Then I use touch foo.txt to create a new text file under foo directory and use vim to open and edit foo.txt 
![Image](command2.png)
cp is copy and cat prints the content of the txt file

Thank you for reviewing this lab report!
